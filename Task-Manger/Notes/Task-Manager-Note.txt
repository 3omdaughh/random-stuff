Hello, today we have a program called Task Manager, to not waste time.
This program is like a to-do list; you will type your tasks as follows (Name, Category, Deadline),
and the program will store this data in its storage.
So, when you want to remember what you need to do, you will basically open the app and recall your tasks.

I know the program is not perfect yet to use, but I will add new features ASAP.
Have a nice day ;)
